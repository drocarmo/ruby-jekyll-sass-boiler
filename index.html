  <h2>Wheat, a Jekyll starter-template for designers.</h3>

  <p>Wheat is a great starting point to help any designer to quickly wip out a simple content-managed site, a product marketing page, prototype an idea or even learn more about Jekyll. The hope is that you may find it easy to quickly iterate whilst designing in the browser.</p>

  <p>Here are a few examples of sites built with Wheat:</p>

  — <a href="http://drocarmo.com/resources/" target="_blank">Product Design Resources</a>
  — <a href="http://drocarmo.com/elenco/" target="_blank">Elenco App</a>

  <p>Clone the repository on your local machine and start building:</p>

  <code>git clone https://github.com/drocarmo/wheat.git</code>
