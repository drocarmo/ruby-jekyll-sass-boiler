title: Welcome to Wheat!

<section>
  <p>Wheat is a simple Jekyll template for designers. It is a great starting point to help any designer quickly wip out a simple blog app, a product marketing page, prototype an idea or any instance of building a dynamic site.

  <p>Everything in Wheat was built to be extremely watered down for quick and iterative development. {% for post in site.posts %} <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>{% endfor %}.</p>

  <p> Clone the <a href="https://github.com/drocarmo/wheat" target="_blank">github</a> repository on your local machine and start building:</p>

  <code>git clone https://github.com/drocarmo/wheat.git</code>

  <p>If you wanted a more detailed setup guide, go through the repository <a href="https://github.com/drocarmo/wheat/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">readme file</a>.</p>
