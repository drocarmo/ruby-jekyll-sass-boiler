Wheat, a Jekyll starter-template for designers.

#### How to get started:

1. Open your terminal.app in your designated directory and paste this code: `git clone git@github.com:drocarmo/wheat.git`

2. Run `rake`

3. Open your browser in localhost:4000

4. Begin customizing your new Jekyll site!

#### A few pointers if you're brand new to Jekyll:

— First, you have to [install](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) Jekyll.

— Read through the Jekyll documentation [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

— Go through my friend Greg's [setup guide](http://vgdub.com/blog/building-a-blog-with-jekyll/).

— Familarize yourself with the Jekyll structure by looking at some other excellent, more advanced Jekyll examples: [Robb's Jekyll repository](https://github.com/robbschiller/jekyll-boilerplate), [Greg's Jekyll repository](https://github.com/vgdub/vgdub.github.io) and [Mig's Jekyll repository](https://github.com/migreyes/hazelnut).

Any other questions? I'd be happy to help, just [shoot me a note.](mailto:pe@drocarmo.com?subject=Hey Pedro&amp;body=I need some help with Wheat..)
